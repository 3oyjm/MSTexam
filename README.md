# MSTexam

Goal is to make small modular scripts that sets up the server rather than one big one.
I wont know what exactly the exam will require off me and what services they will ask for, having small scripts will let me deploy the services asked for, and not everything else at the same time.

The scripts will rely on variables that can easily be edited to suit the exam needs.

# Potential useful scripts for MST exam
